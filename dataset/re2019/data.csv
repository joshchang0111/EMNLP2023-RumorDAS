6o9ozz,dkforfa,1,2,19,502,"You are on the right track . A few additional points : * The bulk of the mass ( 90 % or more of total mass ! ) that you lift out of the gravity well , is in fact the fuel that you are using to lift you out of the gravity well . This is why rockets use stages , so they can abandon the empty tanks as soon as they are empty . * * See the fuel paradox section of this article $URL$ * As you said , the moon's gravity is much weaker , and wouldn't take that much to escape ( 1/6 of the cost of lifting that same mass from earth . And additionally , we were lifting much less mass from the moon than we lifted from earth ) * * Added to that , for the actual moon landing , we only took enough fuel to get back into moon-orbit . All the rest of the fuel stayed in orbit around the moon for the trip back to earth . * * all the abandoned rocket stages on earth , all the fuel that had already been spent , the command module in moon orbit , the parts of the Lunar Module we left on the moon , the rover , etc was all mass we didn't have to move around the second time , making the fuel requirements cheaper . * The entire moon journey was in orbit around the earth . It took relatively little fuel to push us towards the moon , and then come back . Notably , had we missed the moon , we would have come back to earth automatically , without expending further fuel ( although perhaps the astronauts would have run out of air first ) * * This was used for practical effect in Apollo 13 where they just did a trip around the moon and came back , because if they didn't actually have enough fuel to "" turn around "" at the time that the accident happened * * This type of logic was a major plot point in the book version of the Martian * During the trip to / from , spending additional fuel just gets you there faster , but every bit of fuel you spend speeding you up , you might also have to spend slowing you down again ( absent using the gravity well for that purpose ) - so they minimize the amount of fuel the actually use for the trip , and save it mostly for emergencies and course corrections . If it takes you 30 days , or 35 days probably isn't a big deal as long as you planned for it , and the additional cost / weight of the fuel to do it in 5 days less is prohibitive ) . - So they figure out the acceptable mission length , and take enough fuel for that to work out .

If you have knowledge of the ' ratio ' of the fuel necessary to get to the moon ( i . e . get out of the earth's gravity well ) vs . the fuel needed to get a much smaller vehicle in and out of the moon-orbit and then back into the earth-orbit that takes it home , that would be very helpful :) Thanks for giving me further things to google though !

5mkmg1,dc49ttw,1,5,4,383,"Lol natural news . On a serious note , even if the 97 % consensus is "" bunk "" the science is not . Edit : I'm going to expand on this a little more and explain why the science is not bunk : Firstly , we know that CO2 traps heat , it is a greenhouse gas just like methane and water vapour . The way these molecules trap heat is easy : they absorb the radiation , keep it then radiate it out in all directions . Other molecules then pick up this radiated heat and the cycles continues . The way this becomes a problem is due to positive feedback , which is a way of saying "" something causes itself "" . Heating the atmosphere has another effect , heating up air allows for it to absorb more water vapour and since water vapour is a GHG , yeah you're seeing where this is going . The warmer the atmosphere gets , the more GHG's it can absorb and so on . Now where deniers get this wrong is the whole state of the CO2 . Yes plants and trees absorb CO2 , the issue is that this cycle ( aptly named the Carbon Cycle ) was in equalibium , the amount of CO2 entering the atmosphere was equal to the amount leaving . Now it is not equal , the amount entering the atmosphere is far more than the total biomass can absorb and thus a net increase . I hope this clears up certain myths because the science of climate change is really not difficult to understand .

5mkmg1,dc4jv0p,2,6,4,383,"This is the entire problem with using bandwagon fallacies as an argument for something . You end up arguing things that really shouldn't matter - it doesn't matter whether 2 , 50 or 97 % of scientists "" endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming "" - and arguing the percentage is a waste of time . If they want to argue against man made climate change they need to provide evidence that the climate isn't changing due to man's actions . Still - here we are . First thing I noticed was that it talks about one survey , when multiple have been conducted showing similar percentages , the wikipedia article you linked talks about Harris Interactive's survey of 489 randomly selected scientists , the 2013 paper in Environmental Research Letters that looked at 11,944 abstracts - I believe there have been others . The site seems to ignore these . The other things that jump out at me are . > the researchers then selected 79 of their sample and declared them ‚Äú experts . "" Well no the researchers did not do that , those surveyed did - by publishing papers on climate change - it shouldn't be a surprise that out of 3,146 scientists only 79 of them were climate scientists ... It's a poor way to decide if man made climate change is correct or not - but I don't think the poll claims that it is . > So if I send out an email survey to 1000 people , and then I hand-pick the 75 responses I like the best , then can I proclaim those results to be "" settled science "" too ? Will Al Gore champion my cause and demand billions in reparations from first world nations on my behalf ? No because it doesn't prove anything , nor is that an accurate description of what happened , nor should this ( sadly it is ) used to describe how correct anthropomorphic climate change is . So sure , if we ignore all other surveys that confirm the statistic - then this alone as a support for anthropomorphic climate change is weak , usefully there are other things supporting man made climate change other than one email poll .

Though nicotine can have bad side effects in excess ( as almost all drugs , including caffeine ) and is very addictive ( roughly as addictive as morphine ) the main health problems associated with smoking concern the build up of carcinogens and various oxidants that cause a myriad of physiological damage that would take me a few hours to type out comprehensively . Nicotine itself is not considered carcinogenic , which is why nicotine therapies ( like a patch ) are favored over cigarette use . It gives the person the nicotine fix ( albeit , less effective than inhaling ) without loading down your body with the huge list of added chemicals in cigarettes . Is nicotine good for you ? No , its not . It can cause hypertension , birth problems , and a few other minor problems . However , caffeine and ethanol are both "" not good "" for you in most contexts , and its all about weighing out their potential health risks with whatever value we place on their psychoactive effects . It is absolutely true , though , that cigarettes carry with them a lot of baggage that causes many of the health problems associated with smoking , and the only reason people smoke is because of nicotine , so in that sense it is the "" worst "" thing in a cig .

The mechanisms by which cigarette smoking accelerates atherosclerosis and precipitates acute coronary events are complex . The main responsible constituents are combustion products , including oxidizing chemicals , acrolein , butadiene , metals ( such as cadmium ) , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , particulates , and carbon monoxide . Oxidizing chemicals increase free radicals , increase lipid peroxidation , and contribute to several potential mechanisms of cardiovascular disease , including inflammation , endothelial dysfunction , oxidation of LDL , and platelet activation . Nicotine may also contribute to acute coronary events . There are a number of ways in which nicotine can affect the cardiovascular system to increase the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction Also , wikipedia has alot of this information . Now , your friend may think an e cig is absolutely safe . This is a dubious claim , since , not only does nicotine have some negative side effects , but the current regulations on e cigs are effectively non-existent . This means their may be some other various chemicals that make them unsafe . They are a fairly new thing so research is insufficient .

While I believe there will be numerous near-certainties and likely occurrences , these are purely things that will happen . Copying and pasting ruins the formatting , so here's a short sample : - The UK will leave all EU treaties after 2 years from a ‚Äú No ‚Äù vote unless . For this period the UK will be subject to all the laws , but have no vote on them . This will be avoided if : - A qualified majority of remaining member states and a majority of the European Parliament agree and ratify on a settlement . - All 27 remaining member states agree and ratify an extension of this . - Trade deals alone take 5-10 years or more . Negotiating anything beyond this ( such as EEA membership or similar ) would take a similar amount of time . More complex deals would logically take longer . - While these timescales cannot be ‚Äú known ‚Äù , a faster negotiation would be record-breaking . - Britain hasn ‚Äô t negotiated a trade deal for 40 years . We would need time to build up the resources and expertise for negotiation and dealing with trade defence cases . - A shorter example is that of the EEA ; it took from 1989 to 1994 - 12.6 % of UK GDP is linked to exports to the EU , while only 3.1 % of other EU member states GDP is linked to exports to the UK . Any proposition that that ‚Äú they need us more than we need them ‚Äù and as such the EU will be desperate to give the UK a special deal in rapid time for economic reasons doesn ‚Äô t hold up . - The simplest free trade deal would be EEA membership . This entails : - Large membership fees - Freedom of movement - Following a vast majority of the laws - All three of these are cited by anti-EU people as reasons to leave in the first place , so I personally doubt this would be seen as a better situation .

That is because of suppressive fire . But I must say that it's hard to figure out the motivations for suppressive fire , it could be caused by combat stress or opposing enemy suppressive fire causing soldiers to , or it could be a result of a psychological factor that results in people to avoid aiming directly at an enemy ( few people want to kill another person ) . I also would like to say it's pretty unlikely for soldiers to admit in front of their comrades that they didn't even attempt to kill an enemy .

22o24j,cgoq9oi,1,4,25,561,"This claim comes from ' Man Against Fire ' by S . L . A . Marshall , who was a US Army historian for WW2 . He's fairly controversial , as is the book , and the 15 % - 20 % figure comes from his book , although it's misquoted . For one , he's basing it off interviews he did , which isn't exactly a good piece of evidence . Also , it's more specific then is stated . Only 15-20 % of * American riflemen * fired their * personal * weapons * at an exposed enemy soldier * . This makes the statistic a lot more understandable , because it excludes crew-served weapons ( machine guns ) , and key weapons ( flamethrowers ) . While his numbers were initially accepted and frequently quoted , they've been called into question several times . One of the larger things I've seen pointed out in rebuttals of his statistics is that it fails to distinguish between soldiers who * can * fire , and shoulders who * should * fire . A medic has a sidearm . Should he be firing at an exposed soldier , or should he be doing his normal duties ? What about squad leaders , more focused on directing the battle then taking shots themselves ? [ This ] ( $URL$ ) is an excellent breakdown of why his methods were called into question , and includes an interview by the man who accompanied him through his interviews in the Korean war ( which came up with a 50 % fire rate ) . Some sample issues with his work include that he didn't interview casualties , only unharmed men who were still ready for action , that he didn't take into account things like weapons jamming , and that his numbers were based more on guesses then anything else . It wasn't a proper survey even , but instead a group discussion he'd pull information out of . Simply put ... it's just not very good history . It's hard to get a proper number for how many soldiers fired their guns , but the 15-20 % is more or less impossible to back up , and completely ignores several significant factors .

22o24j,cgoqevd,1,5,25,561,"That claim is based on the books "" On Killing : The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society "" , by David Grossman ; and "" Men against Fire "" , by SLA Marshall . I'll get my bias out here - I think this idea is crap , and the basic reason is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence , and there is no evidence to support that claim . Marshall's work , wherein he makes the claim that 75 % of soldiers do not fire on the enemy , was based on post-combat interviews with soldiers , but no record of any questions about the ratio of fire exists . In fact , the only record of his interviews at all ( besides his books ) , makes mention of soldiers firing weapons , but nothing whatsoever that could support a hard number of how many men fired or did not fire . There is no evidence of statistical analysis based on his interviews , no records of questions about whether soldiers fired or not , no questions about ammunition consumption . There is no evidence from quartermasters about ammunition consumption , barrel wear , or any other secondary evidence . So this number is one that Marshall may have arrived at honestly , but there is simply no evidence to support it . If you're interested , Robert Engen wrote a very incisive article on the subject in the Canadian Military Journal , and wrote his Masters thesis on the subject . Engen found ( and has the evidence to prove ) that - for Canadians , at the very least - did not have this problem . Based on primary sources ( written post-combat interviews with Canadian officers ) , he found * exactly the opposite * of what Marshall and Grossman claim .

It is full of examples of counter-intuitive behaviour and emphasises that once battle is joined the situation is so chaotic that typical predictions of human behaviour do not hold true . Who would have thought that a large number of Argentinian soldiers at Goose Green would have responded to bombardment by getting into their sleeping bags ? The major problems with this whole subject area is that there is not a continuous stream of armed actions which can be directly observed by psychologists and , in common with the majority of social research , it is impossible to control for the relevant variables : > "" Everyone stop ! OK , now I want Smoggins to stand up and let ‚Äô s see if Gruber over there fires at him . "" Almost everything in this area is laced with bias . Soldiers don't want to be seen as cowards , commanders want to believe their men are good fighters , very few people understand what battle is actually like , very few psychologists are soldiers , very few soldiers are psychologists and it is very rare to find scholars with relevant military experience who can combine academic rigour in both history and psychology . * On the Psychology of Military Incompetence * by Norman Dixon is a good example : Dixon was a Major in the Royal Engineers and an esteemed psychologist , but the historical section of his book is extremely suspect - especially his treatment of World War One . Against this backdrop I see Marshall's and Grossman's works as important contributions to a poorly studied area in which no one can produce any definitive research . What is not in any doubt is that western militaries have gone to great lengths since the end of World War Two to develop sophisticated , realistic training environments to prepare soldiers for battle and develop instinctive responses to stimuli : in effect to stop the soldier from thinking .

Our understanding of fossilisation comes from our understandings of chemistry and biology . 3 ) All of these other disciplines are tested by the fact that we _use_ them . We use geology to find oils and minerals and predict the weather and choose where to build huge buildings . We use biology and chemistry in a huge range of applications , from chemical engineering to antibiotics to heart transplants to modern crop farming . We have nuclear reactors that have been churning out predicable power for decades , and satellites serving our communications , and millions of aeroplanes safely running about the skies . We have cellphones . 4 ) All of the above are using exactly the same understandings about the world that paleontologists use to date dinosaur bones and evolutionary scientists use to understand the development of modern species . It's all the same mechanics , just a slightly different application . To say that the knowledge is somehow wrong is like saying that a man who is an excellent driver of a four-door sedan can in no way know _anything_ about driving a hatchback . So , this leads us to one of three conclusions . Either ... a ) We're somehow wrong about how everything works , and all the stuff we've managed to do is sheer luck that it works , despite our misunderstanding . b ) It's all a giant ' evolutionist ' conspiracy , one that would have to involve so many people that it would be almost a majority of the population ( at least , the population with power and influence ) . The point of such a conspiracy would be unclear , since I can't see a real reward . c ) The bible literalists are wrong . Personally , I'm leaning towards ' c ' as the most likely answer .

From p . 14 Discussion \ ( my commentary in brackets \ ): First , consistent with previous research , self \ - reported offending prior to engagement with the justice system \ ( i . e . , first arrest \ ) is relatively and consistently low for immigrants generally and for undocumented immigrants specifically compared to their US \ - born peers . \ [ immigrants and undocumented immigrants self reported that they committed fewer crimes compared to whites in their initial interviews , whoa guess we'll take their word on that ; not like there isn't rampant evidence that victims in immigrants neighborhoods are less likely to go to the cops \ ( fewer victims come forward , fewer arrests made \ ); see my previous posts in another parent thread \ ] Second , compared to their documented immigrant and US \ - born peers , undocumented immigrants continue to report low levels of offending in the three \ - years following first arrest . \ [ undocumented immigrants in the follow up interviews self \ - reported that they are committing fewer crimes ; of course they would , they fear deportation \ ] Third , and in contrast to the findings for self \ - reported offending , undocumented immigrants are more likely to be re \ - arrested and are re \ - arrested more in the three \ - years following their first arrest . Differences in the risk of re \ - arrest appear to be most pronounced immediately following their first arrest . \ [ hang on , now the study is looking at actual arrests , which reveal undocumented immigrants were lying in their interviews , maybe the self \ - reported evidence isn't so robust ? \ ] ",true,comment

To reiterate , the premise of your argument , ie "" this is all just a bunch of thoughts and feelings "" , in reality , are researchers asking specific questions about their experiences with criminal behavior etc . That is actually a valid approach in determining if someone has been arrested , you know , by simply asking them if they've been arrested or involved in criminal behavior .

4eo2zi,d22gr7t,1,9,9,1326,"I can't believe people are missing the two obvious flaws in this analysis . This infographic doesn't show that 6 companies control 90 % of the media . It doesn't provide any basis for the 90 % figure . That's just a number pulled out of the air . All it shows is that 6 companies create and / or distribute a lot of media content . There are other problems , too . I will update this when I get a few minutes to expand on it . EDIT : Ok , let's explore why this graphic is partly true , partly false and partly misleading . This isn't a comprehensive examination , just a look at some problems that stood out to me . > * ‚Äú Media has never been more consolidated . 6 media giants now control a staggering 90 % of what we read , watch or listen to . ‚Äù * The most fundamental problem is here . They give the numerator ( the 6 media giants and the media they create or distribute ) , but never give the denominator ( the total amount of media Americans consume ) . In fact , the infographic seems to suggest that it is basically just comparing ownership of the largest media outlets in 1983 to ownership of those same outlets today ... as if media consumption today is , apart from ownership , the same as it was in 1983 . * > "" 232 Media executives control the information diet of 277 million Americans "" * Where do these numbers come from ? How does he arrive at 232 media executives ? What constitutes "" executive "" or "" control "" or an executive with control ? The infographic does not explain . These are just numbers thrown out without any context or apparent methodology . The infographic says the Comcast / NBC merger guarantees "" monopoly of 11 US markets like NYC and Chicago . "" I have no idea what that is even supposed to mean . Comcast is not the only provider in NYC or Chicago , and NBCUniversal was not the only cable channel / content producer / network , so in what sense did the merger create a "" monopoly "" in 11 markets ? * > "" In 1995 , the FCC forbade companies ownership of more than 40 stations . Clear Channel Communications now owns over 1,500 . "" * In 1996 , Congress updated the Communications Act and eased ownership restrictions . As a result , some companies started buying a lot of radio stations . Many of those companies are now struggling to stay afloat , because radio audiences have cratered due to the rise of things like the iPod , satellite radio and the Internet . But , you argue , maybe radio would be doing better if it was still locally owned instead of owned by big chains . That's a valid hypothesis . Unfortunately , locally owned and operated radio stations are not doing particularly well , either . The entire industry is struggling . The ability to achieve economies of scale has helped many radio stations that would otherwise be even further underwater . This benefit , however , is balanced against the tremendous debt burden that ClearChannel and other big companies took on when buying up stations . In any event , "" 80 % of stations ' playlists match "" because people are mostly the same everywhere . As exotic as those yankees / southerners / west coasters / midwesterners / people from Florida may seem to us , folks in other parts of the United States really aren't * all * that different . Well , maybe people from Florida are , but the rest of us are pretty similar . There are some differences , which is why some areas have more country / rap / alternative / jazz / classical stations than others , but people who like classic rock mostly like the same bands and songs . People who like top 40 mostly like the same bands and songs . Radio stations do extensive audience testing to determine their playlists , to measure what songs are getting "" burned "" and what songs audiences like ( or might like ) . There are some regional differences , but people mostly like the same things . People in radio often hear outsiders who are certain they know what the station should do differently - - more new music , more variety , whatever - - and , frankly , many radio people would prefer their stations had more variety and were more inventive . But you know what ? They also realize that what people say they want and what people * actually listen to * are two pretty different things . If "" more new music / more variety "" worked consistently , radio stations would do that , because money . * > "" The Big Six's box office sales hit $ 7 billion in 2010 , that's 2X the box office sales of the next 140 Studios * "" Wait , earlier the infographic were talking about how a few media giants "" control "" the media by owning everything . But this is a different claim . This claims that the few media giants are just * more successful * than "" the next 140 studios "" . If there are 146 studios , then it sounds like there's a lot of competition to produce content and people just prefer the content produced by the "" Big 6 "" ... or , in reality , produced by one of many , many other studios and bought by the "" Big 6 "" for distribution . And finally , the infographic closes with this dire warning : "" Until regulations return ( or they buy each other out of existence ) , they will continue to control 90 % of everything Americans see , hear and consider important . "" Sounds serious , right ? Now consider what some of the "" media consolidation "" Pollyanna's [ were saying 15 years ago ] ( $URL$ ) . > "" The Internet has not yet evolved into a ubiquitous mass communications medium that can challenge the other media . "" Yeah ? How are those radio stations , newspapers and magazines holding up these days ? > "" The increasing concentration of the Internet is stunning . AOL's dominance of subscribership in the U . S . is widely noted ... Even more striking is the growth in the concentration of usage . Because the number of potential online channels is infinite , some assume that market dominance is an impossibility on the Internet . This is faulty reasoning . ... Analysis of Media Metrix data over the past three years shows an incontrovertible trend toward online media consolidation ‚Ä¶ . Between March 1999 and March 2001 , the total number of companies controlling 50 percent of user minutes online decreased by nearly two-thirds , from 11 to four . Because AOL has such a dominant position ( over 30 percent of user time ) the HHI is about 1200 , well above the moderately concentrated threshold . The four firm concentration ratio also falls in the range where concerns about concentration and the abuse of market power begin . Yes , 15 years ago they were Deeply Concerned that a few companies , mainly AOL , would "" control "" online media . Shortly thereafter , AOL collapsed , Google and Facebook rose and every asshole with a Twitter account became their own media provider . There are big media companies . There always have been .

4ycnf5,d6mry0q,1,6,12,197,"Our species is very young , and no part of Antarctica has been habitable by humans within the timeframe of the entire existence of our species . It is literally impossible for there to be ' ancient ' human settlements on that continent . Visitations , maybe , though I'd call even that unlikely before relatively modern times , and they'd have to leave much more spare traces , and in nearly all cases and evidence would have been destroyed long ago by the very harsh conditions there . What * is * true , however , is that ' lost ' Antarctic expeditions of the much more recent path - - we're talking more like a century ago - - * have * been sometimes found there , including fairly recently . Because just getting there is such an enormous undertaking , we at least know that they * went * there , even if we don't know what became of them . There haven't been many such expeditions , however , so it's not like there are numerous lost artefacts to be found . Maybe half a dozen at most not already located . ",unverified,comment
4ycnf5,d6mskmq,1,7,12,197,"I converted the first set of coordinates . It maps to an area in the southern range of the Russian tundra . The other coordinates are clearly similar . The images mostly likely are of archaelogical investigations of older Chukchi settlements . The Chukchi , who are still around , are nomadic tribes of Russia's high north who have been around for probably thousands of years , and their ancestors are the likely ancestors of the majority of Native Americans .

7g16as,dqfx6xk,13,14,9,150,"> Because if it is only costing Trump 10 million vs . Obama's 114 million , where did that 94 million go ? Obama's $ 114 million was for all of his travel expenses in his entire 8 years in office . Trump's $ 10 million is for all of his travel expenses * so far * since taking office , which has been just over 10 months . That puts Obama's average per-month travel expenses at $ 1.18 million and Trump's average per-month travel expenses at $ 1.0 million . There is no missing $ 94 million , and I expect if Trump continues at this trend and somehow manages to stay in office for a full two terms , he will end up with around $ 100 million in travel expenses himself .

7g16as,dqg6pmv,14,19,9,150,"> Trump's $ 10 million is for all of his travel expenses so far since taking office , which has been just over 10 months . JudicialWatch is reporting on FOIA requests they filed back in July , they haven't released any expenses more recent than June that I can find . So technically , the $ 10million is only for his first 5 months in office , and we don't have any numbers for the past 5 months yet . He's on track to spend approximately $ 20million in his first year . That's also assuming that JW has found all of Trump's spending up through June . Seeing as how they're still receiving FOIA request information on the Obama Family's spending from way back in 2014 , I seriously doubt Trump's is complete either . ",false,comment
